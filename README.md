# workspace
I wanted to create a different ecosystem for
office workspace using Spring and Hibernate JPA, called WorkSpace.
It can be used by any software company for maintaining day to day
development related task scheduling, setting up team meetings, contacts
and mails, all in one place.
Entities:
● User
● Team
● Task
● Posts
● Message Thread
● Message
● Meetings
Features:
● Users can view tasks, meetings and posts in the dashboard.
● Users can create personal tasks and send them to other users.
● Teamleads can set team tasks
● Anyone can post and set the audience for the posts.
● Create meetings and set the corresponding invited users, getting
them notified.
● Users can message other users, also group messages.

● Teamleads can add users as teammates.
● They can also update team status.
